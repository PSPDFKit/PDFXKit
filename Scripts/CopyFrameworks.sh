# This script copies all frameworks contained in the `Frameworks` directory
# into Xcode's built products directory. It needs to be run before the
# "Embed Frameworks" build phase which requires those frameworks to be present.
#
# Why not copy the frameworks directly? This indirection allows us at PSPDFKit
# to work on PDFXKit while linking to the actual source PSPDFKit Xcode project.
